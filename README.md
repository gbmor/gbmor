I enjoy writing software, and I run a public-access OpenBSD system called [tilde.institute](https://tilde.institute).

My free time is usually spent:
- working on side projects I may not ever finish
- playing MUDs and roguelikes
- hanging out on IRC
- teaching possums to sing and play the piano

My personal site is at [gbmor.org](https://gbmor.org). You can grab my [pgp key](https://gbmor.org/key.pub) if you're into that sort of thing.
