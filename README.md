I enjoy writing software, and I run a public-access OpenBSD system called [tilde.institute](https://tilde.institute).

My personal site is at [gbmor.dev](https://gbmor.dev). You can grab my [pgp key](https://gbmor.dev/key.pub) if you're into that sort of thing.

My free time is usually spent:
- hanging out on IRC
- working on side projects I may not ever finish
- playing MUDs and roguelikes
- training possums to play piano
