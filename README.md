# ~gbmor

I enjoy writing software, and I run a public-access OpenBSD system called [tilde.institute](https://tilde.institute).

My personal site is at [gbmor.dev](https://gbmor.dev). You can grab my [pgp key](https://gbmor.dev/key.pub) if you're into that sort of thing.

In my free time, I hang out on IRC, work on a bunch of side projects I may not ever finish, and play MUDs and roguelikes.
